        About Me
        <p>I am in my last class for the web developement certificate program. 
            I have 3 cats at the moment:
            <ol>Leo, slightly orange.</ol>
            <ol>Matilda, white with a red and blue eye.</ol>
            <ol>Then currently housing a rescue named Haley that's been pregnant probably 3 times.</ol>

        Hobbies/interests
        <p>I love learning about how stuff works.
          I am addicted to installing GNU/linux on anything
          I can get my hands on. I've tried Ubunto first, then 
          Debian distributions like stock Debian and Parrot OS,
          and have tried compiling from source with distributions
          like Gentoo. I love learning about cyber security and pentesting.
          I am very interested in specifically web applications and finding
          vulnerabilities ethically within them.   
        </p>

        Adobe Experience
        <p>I have little Adobe experience. From these Devry classes I was able to learn 
            Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe Illustrator.  </p>

        Future Plans
        <p>I don't mind common retail jobs as there is always a need for them.
            But, I want to one day be a Developer of some kind. Heck I could even be 
            a janitor at Microsoft Headquarters or something. I just need to get my feet wet.
            Maybe learn Cisco Networking as an alternative because I've always been 
            in the wires so to speak. As long as I can remember.
